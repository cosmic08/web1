  <p style=margin-top:50px;>What is product design? Can't anyone design a product? Can only human design objects? Why are we appealed to certain style? What is beauty? Is designer special? What is ultimate? What can I do?</p>
  <p style=margin-top:10px;>Question myself everyday.Being able to see the reflection of light through the air. You might be able to observe beauty through your eyes. What if I'm blind? What can feel beautiful and attached? Touch. If certain feeling of the surface makes you happy, what happens when the product is untouchable? Voice,AI. Can AI be the ultimate solution to handicaps from advancing technolgy? I myself had visioned evoluted virtual reality or hologram technology. But now I realized that new technology can neglect certain people in society if you forget to consider the downside.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:10px;">So my first challenge is to find out how much the 3 dimensional objects effect our lives in daily basis. Can hologram or AI fulfill our needs and happiness while saving many resources on the earth? How can this new technology applied to this world?</p>
